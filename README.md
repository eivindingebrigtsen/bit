# Background

  ASKED TO NAME an event that has reshaped finance in recent years, bankers will point to the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15th 2008…

  Fintech types are more likely to mention something that happened six weeks later. On October 31st 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous cryptography buff whose real identity remains a mystery, unveiled a project he dubbed bitcoin, “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party”.

# [Crypto Anarchist Manifesto](http://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html) 

Date: Sun, 22 Nov 92 12:11:24 PST

  Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner.

# [Bmoney](http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt)

  Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word "anarchy", in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It's a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.

- Wei Dai

# [Bitcoin Paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

  … a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust …  
  peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to 
  record a public history of transactions
  that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change
  if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power …

  The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.
- Satoshi Nakamoto Nov 2008

# Blockchain

    The blockchain is a technology that is used to continuously record every bitcoin transaction that takes place. It is a distributed database or public ledger that updates itself every 10 minutes. This distributed database is operated by miners whose only qualification to become a miner is that they have the money to buy and maintain the super computers needed to process transactions every 10 minutes.

# So it's just another database?

- Blockchain enables a shared database
- It answers the question: Is the database in a valid state? 
- But it doesn't fix problems of trust

  __We need a whole bunch of new stuff for shared write databases to work, and it just so happens that blockchains provide them.__

- Regular peer-to-peer techniques
- Grouping transactions into blocks
- One-way cryptographic hash functions
- A multi-party consensus algorithm
- Distributed multiversion concurrency control 
- Per-row permissions based on public key cryptography
