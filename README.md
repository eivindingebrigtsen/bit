  ASKED TO NAME an event that has reshaped finance in recent years, bankers will point to the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15th 2008, the nadir of the financial crisis. The collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15th 2008, the nadir of the financial crisis. 

  Fintech types are more likely to mention something that happened six weeks later. On October 31st 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous cryptography buff whose real identity remains a mystery, unveiled a project he dubbed bitcoin, “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party”.

  Unlike the communities traditionally associated with the word "anarchy", in a crypto-anarchy the government is not temporarily destroyed but permanently forbidden and permanently unnecessary. It's a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.

# [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

  … a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust …  
  peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to 
  record a public history of transactions
  that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change
  if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power …

  The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.
- Satoshi Nakamoto Nov 2008

# So it's just another database?

- Blockchain enables shared database
- It answers the question: Is the database in a valid state? 
- But it doesn't fix problems of trust

  __We need a whole bunch of new stuff for shared write databases to work, and it just so happens that blockchains provide them.__
  key elements include regular peer-to-peer techniques, grouping transactions into blocks, one-way cryptographic hash functions, a multi-party consensus algorithm, distributed multiversion concurrency control and per-row permissions based on public key cryptography.
